Hi I'm r3dspace! I'm a sys-admin based out of Germany working as an second and third level network engineer. I create, maintain and update networks all day long. I'm passionate about side projects and helping other admins improve their craft and networks.

This documentation hub is meant to assist in the configuration in networks and its services.
